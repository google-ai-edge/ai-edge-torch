r"""Exporting HF LLM model to LiteRT-LM file.
"""

from ai_edge_torch.generative.export_hf import export as lib

# Thing to do:
# * Support re-using re-authored model in torch generative if possible.
# * Support runtime BMM / attention.
# * Support model specific mask generation.
# * Support dynamic rope and long rope.
# * Support quantized safetensor.
# * Support advanced PTQ techniques.
# * Models other than CausalLM.
